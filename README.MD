### Citybiker
###### by tomo



This project was developed for an assignment in the course [IN5320 Development in Platform Ecosystems](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5320/)

Sometimes I want to know if there's an available citybike close to me. If there is none close by, I want know to what options public transport are available near by.
This site solves that problem.

Made using Express, NodeJS, React and Bulma.


Build the client with __npm build__

Then __npm install__ and __npm start__ to start running the server.


Api keys must be provided to _services/entur.js_, _services/citybikes.js_ and _client/src/MapContainer.js_
